# FrameworkSTL
Framework Test Slab STL
A test STL file for printing a compliant logo slab for the framework power button challenge. Its purpose it to show off that it is squishy yet durable. Please do not print this with a yellow filament, it is more brittle. There are a bunch of youtube videos that will show that off.
